# Precise Sky — Weather forecast website

 Precise Sky is a convenient and user-friendly tool that allows you to quickly and easily check the current weather and forecast for the next 2 days in any city. Simply type the name of the city you're interested in, and the web app will use the OenWeatherAPI and GeolocationAPI  to retrieve the latest weather data and display it in an easy-to-read format.

## Tech/framework used

Designed and Built with React, CSS, GeolocationAPI, and OpenWeatherAPI.

## Problems and Thought Process


I've crafted a dynamic weather app that delivers a seamless user experience and accurate, up-to-date forecasts. It seamlessly blends the power of React, CSS, Highcharts, GeolocationAPI and OpenWeatherAPI to achieve the following:

Interactive and Responsive Interface: React, a leading JavaScript library, empowers the app with a dynamic interface that responds effortlessly to user interactions, ensuring a smooth and engaging experience.

Visually Appealing Design: CSS artfully styles the app's visual elements, creating an aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly environment.

Informative Visual Data Representation: Highcharts seamlessly transforms weather data into clear and informative charts, enabling users to grasp temperature trends, humidity levels, and expected weather conditions with ease.

Accurate Location-Based Forecasts: The GeolocationAPI pinpoints a user's location using their IP address, while the OpenWeatherAPI delivers precise current and forecasted weather data for that specific location. This powerful combination ensures users access the most relevant and up-to-date weather information for their chosen city.

## Leassons Learned


This project was a masterclass in pushing my web development skills. Crafting a responsive dashboard with CSS flexbox was a journey in layout mastery, and I mastered the art of customizing charts with react-Highcharts. But the real challenge was wrangling the GeolocationAPI and OpenWeatherAPI. Decoding user location, retrieving weather data, and shaping it for display – that's where I truly leveled up. In the end, I conquered APIs, user interactions, and UI design, building a functional, efficient app that makes me proud. This project fueled my hunger to learn and grow, and I can't wait to see what new peaks I'll conquer as a developer.
